Git repository with Eclipse plugin bundles of the CDK modules and additionaly required libraries.

Two main branches are maintained:

* master := CDK master
* cdk-jchempaint := CDK master + the CDK-JChemPaint patch

If you need rendering and/or editing functionality, you need the latter branch.

Additional branches may be present for application specific patches (to be decided at a later stage).
